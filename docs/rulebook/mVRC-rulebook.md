## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Document scope and purpose

This document specifies the “European Union mobile Vehicle Registration Certificate (EU-mVRC)” in accordance with EU Directive on the registration documents for vehicles \[EU DIR 2025/0096][EU DIR 1999/37]. An EU-mVRC is a mobile document, i.e. QEAA or Pub-EAA, managed by an EUDI Wallet according to [European Digital Identity Regulation]. The specification of the EU-mVRC is a profile of the mVC specified in [ISO/IEC 7367-2]. The approach of specifying the EU-mVRC profile is given in 2.1. The EU-mVRC as well as the mobile Technical Report (mTR) [ISO/IEC 7367-3] are considered companion documents to the mDL as specified in ARF Annex 3.2 mDL Rulebook.

### 1.2 Document structure

- Chapter 2, which describes the approach of specifying the EU profile of an ISO-mVC
- Chapter 3, which specifies how the attestation, attributes and metadata are encoded in case the attestation complies with [ISO/IEC 18013-5] .
- Chapter 4, which specifies attestation usage.
- Chapter 5, which defines how trust anchors for attestation verification can be obtained.
- Chapter 6, which defines attestation revocation mechanisms.
- Chapter 7, which provides compliance information.
- Annex A, which describes a mapping of data elements of COUNCIL DIRECTIVE to the EU-mVRC

### 1.3 Key words

This document uses the capitalised key words 'SHALL', 'SHOULD' and 'MAY' as
specified in [RFC 2119], i.e., to indicate requirements, recommendations and
options specified in this document.

In addition, 'must' (non-capitalised) is used to indicate an external
constraint, i.e., a requirement that is not mandated by this document, but, for
instance, by an external document. The word 'can' indicates a capability,
whereas other words, such as 'will', and 'is' or 'are' are intended as
statements of fact.

### 1.4 Terminology

This document uses the terminology specified in Annex 1 of the ARF.

## 2 Attestation attributes and metadata

### 2.1 Introduction

This document describes the structure, type, data element identifiers, and logical organisation of the mandatory and optional attributes of the EU-mVRC attestation within the EUDI Wallet. It also describes how Member States can specify any possible national attributes.

The specification of the EU-mVRC is a profile of the mVC specified in [ISO/IEC 7367-2]. The mVC [ISO/IEC 7367-2] references data structures and security mechanisms defined for <credentials:mDL> and <credentials:mdoc>, such as device request/response structures, IssuerSigned and IssuerAuth structures (MSO) as well as protocols for proximity and remote flows. These protocols and structures are mandatory features of the EUDI Wallet ecosystem . The EU-mVRC profile mandates the use of doc type and name space according to [ISO/IEC 7367-2] and gives more detailed information on the use of the data elements. A profile further specifies additional name spaces under responsibility of the EU and of respective Member States.

## 3 Attestation encoding

### 3.1 ISO/IEC 18013-5-compliant encoding

#### 3.1.1 EU mVRC document type and namespace

The objects ``docType`` and ``namespace`` are used to encapsulate the document type and the space in which the data elements are defined.

The document type for the **EU-mVRC** SHALL be as specified in clause 6.1 of [ISO/IEC 7367-2].

The namespace for **EU-mVRC ISO compliant data elements** defined in clause 3.1.2 SHALL be as specified in clause 6.1 of [ISO/IEC 7367-2].

The namespace for **EU-mVRC EU data elements** defined in clause 3.1.3 SHALL be as specified in clauses 6.2.5 and 6.2.6 of [ISO/IEC 7367-2] appended by “EU.1” after a period. The number “1” in the namespace might be increased in future versions of this namespace specification.

Member States MAY add additional namespaces under their responsibility. References to those specifications are given in clause 2.4. The namespace for **EU-mVRC Member State specific data elements** SHALL be as specified in clauses 6.2.5 and 6.2.6 of [ISO/IEC 7367-2] appended by the respective country code of the Member State after a period and optionally followed by a version number.

#### 3.1.2 EU-mVRC ISO compliant data elements

##### 3.1.2.1 Overview

The data elements are specified in Table 1 in clause 3.1.2.2.

— The "Identifier" column is the reference of the data element specified in [ISO/IEC 7367-2].

— The “EU additional description” column gives further information on the usage of the respective data element in the context of [EU DIR 2025/0096].

— The "Presence" column indicates whether the presence of the element on an EU-mVRC is mandatory (M), optional (O) or conditional (C). If an element is conditional the respective condition is given.

##### 3.1.2.2 ISO compliant data elements

## 4 Attestation usage

Use Case of an mVC are given in Annex A.1 and A.2 of [ISO/IEC 7367-2]. Moreover, a typical inspection procedure in a law enforcement use case includes the verification of an mDL, an mVC and mTR in one single request.

## 5 Trust anchors

The certificates specified in Annex C of [ISO/IEC 7367-2] SHALL be used. The Pub-EAA provider MAY use the IACA already set up for mDL according to Annex C of [ISO/IEC 7367-2] or may establish a separate IACA.

## 6 Revocation

If revocation of mVC is required the Pub-EAA provider SHALL provide a status list according to  [ISO/IEC 18013-5.2].

## 7 Compliance

The specification of the mVC is compliant to the ARF, i.e. the mdoc encoding of a Pub-EAA, and [ISO/IEC 7367-2] as well as with [EU DIR 2025/0096].
